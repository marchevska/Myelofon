Myelofon is a EEG sensor and set of required software and firmware. The hardware should be cheap and easy to build even in home by any enthusiast. However Myelofon is not a classical EEG device, it is not designed to reading mutichennal EEG. The responcibility of device is getting the frequency spectrum of the brain activity. Related software analyzes the spectrum to do useful things. It is pretend to be used for cognitive experiments, brainfitness, psychoterapy, children development, entertaiment, etc. Teoretically for any case requires simplified brain feedback.

Myelofon hardware and software is open and licensed under GPL. It means anyone can build devices and specialized software based on Myelofon design freely.
